# Framework Heavy-Lifting Plan

Status: Active
Status detail: Web-specific half of the Core-owned plan, written 2026-10-28 (mode 1); nothing implemented; W0 (Lab verdict from structured data) is first.
Created: 2026-10-28
Last updated: 2026-10-28
Owner: framework-heavy-lifting sub-supervisor (for the lead supervisor)
Scope: Where FluxIQ Core and the web domain can compute or enforce what the build model now has to get right: membership/bounds, judging, undo/reset bookkeeping, handler conditions, toggle state, stable targets, dedupe, paging, and per-call workload.

## Current State

**Core owns this plan.** The findings, the responsibility map, every client contract (CC1-CC14, K1-K7), the phases
P0-P10 and what not to do are in the owning document:
`C:/Users/osrs_/FluxStuff/!FluxIQ/docs/working/framework-heavy-lifting-plan.md` (FluxIQ Core).
This document holds only the web-specific half:

- which domain and extension files fill each Core contract;
- moving web concepts out of Core;
- the Lab reporting fix that every live check depends on.

It links to Core's contracts and does not restate them.

- **True now:** the plan is written and nothing is implemented. The evidence reports in
  `framework-heavy-lifting-plan/reports/` (fhl-debug-notes, fhl-step-workload, fhl-core-surface,
  fhl-domain-surface) fed the Core synthesis.
- **The web side already computes most of what Core needs.** It has toggle signatures, `layerCleared`, the acted-on
  item, location moves, stale-target re-find by identity, value shapes and pagination detection. What is missing is
  emitting them in Core's typed, optional shapes. Two items are wholly new: per-item marks (CC2) and control intent (CC11).
- **Next:** W0 (Lab verdict from structured data) before the first live round. Then each W-phase pairs with its Core
  phase in one Core-paired `pnpm task`, after Core's default has shipped, so Core never waits on the web side.
- **Blocked:** nothing.
- **Unverified premises** (Open Questions below):
  - whether `values` and `differs` are filled for a non-list region;
  - tab and resource identity for witnesses;
  - whether the place token of a looped act embeds the item's page address.

| W-phase | Pairs with Core | Fills |
| --- | --- | --- |
| W0 | none (Lab) | Lab verdict and budget label from structured data |
| W3 | P3 | CC4 places and `placeChanged`, CC5, CC6 |
| W4 | P4 | CC4 `inverse`; one place token per act |
| W5 | P5 | Source element reference and normalisation for stored cells (feeds K4) |
| W6 | P6 | CC7, CC8 rate limit, CC9 |
| W7 | P7 | CC1, CC2, CC3; the date-bound twin |
| W8 | P8 | CC8 `transient`, CC10, CC12; re-find by identity without a source step |
| W10 | P10 | CC11, CC13, CC14; receive the concepts moved out of Core |

P0, P1, P2 and P9 need nothing from the web side. P2 relies on `resource` and `location`, which already ride on every
start-state read.

## Contract fills

Paths: `D/` = `domain/src/`, `E/` = `apps/extension/src/`, `LE/` = `D/runtime/llm-evidence/`. For each contract's shape
and safe default, see Core's "Client contracts" section. Everything below is optional on the wire: a web build that
emits none of it behaves as today.

### W3. Effect places, region values, landing (CC4 places, CC5, CC6)

- **CC4 places and `placeChanged`.** The source is the press-effect reading the domain already makes from the looks
  before and after: `LE/node-run/press-effect/page-changes.ts`, `toggle.ts`, `toggle-signature.ts`, `acted-on.ts`,
  `chosen-state.ts`, plus `LE/control-spot/place.ts`, `states.ts`, `collection.ts`. Emit one `effect` per press, with
  `class` from CC12 and `places[]` as the place tokens whose state token changed.
  - New: a count or total delta. A badge or total in a named region today shows up only as page-change lines; put it
    in `values`.
- **CC5 values of any region.** Fill `values` and `differs` on every start-state read (`LE/start-state/state.ts:7-25`,
  `read-state.ts`, `differences.ts`, `LE/control-spot/values.ts`) for named non-list regions (a total, a badge, a field).
  - Hash only stable text. Reuse the volatile-text rules of `D/runtime/target-reacquire/volatile-text.ts` so times,
    relative dates and rotating promotions do not count as change.
- **CC6 landing.** `D/runtime/state-diff/state-diff.ts:1-22` (`locationChanged` versus `documentChanged`),
  `LE/node-run/start-location.ts` (`webMovesThePage`), and the ARRIVED header (`LE/page-view/header.ts`) give
  `landing {from, to, marksDiffer}`. `marksDiffer` compares the arriving view's state tokens, not its URL.
- Tests: `LE/node-run/press-effect/tests/effect-record.test.ts`, `LE/start-state/tests/region-values-stable.test.ts`,
  `D/runtime/state-diff/tests/landing.test.ts`.

### W4. Inverse acts and one place per act (CC4 `inverse`)

- Inverse descriptors come from effects already recorded, and are never authored:
  - **a toggle:** the reversed `toggle` signature on the same place token (`D/actions/toggle-signature/signature.ts`);
  - **a created item:** its identity, plus the remove control its own row shows, when one is visible;
  - **a navigation:** the location it left;
  - **an action whose CC12 class is `commit`:** `{kind: irreversible}`.
- **The place token of a looped act.** `LE/control-spot/place.ts` builds tokens that include the page address, so the
  same control on two item pages gets two tokens (mvrj-a44a's livelock). Give each control a token that does not change
  with the item's page address, or have Core compare by one place per act (Core P4). Settle which in W4's first task.
- Tests: `D/actions/toggle-signature/tests/inverse.test.ts`, `LE/control-spot/tests/place-per-act.test.ts`.

### W5. Stored cells traceable to the page (feeds Core K4)

- For each stored cell, the read reports which end-view element it was read from and a normalised form (whitespace
  folded, currency symbol and thousands separators kept as separate tokens). Core then checks "verbatim text of one
  element" without a tolerant match.
- Sources: `D/actions/extraction/summary.ts`, `LE/result-observation/`, `E/content/extraction/value-shape.ts`,
  `value-statement.ts`.
- Tests: `D/actions/extraction/tests/cell-source.test.ts`, `E/content/extraction/tests/value-normalised.test.ts`.

### W6. Obstructions, rate limits, stateful controls (CC7, CC8 rate limit, CC9)

- **CC7.** Report an `obstruction` on a covered or failed attempt, and as a standing fact in the view, not only after
  a close. Sources:
  - `E/content/action-runtime/actionability.ts:1-30` (covered, plus its closers);
  - `LE/front-layer.ts`, `layers.ts`, `layer-marks.ts`;
  - `LE/node-run/press-effect/cleared-layer.ts`, `answered-layer.ts`, `LE/way-out-handles/`;
  - the wire in `D/client/gateway-mapping.ts:324-362`, `D/io/gateway-output-dispatcher.ts:90` and `D/actions/types.ts:603`.
  - Map the web layer kinds to Core's generic ones: consent to `overlay`, promotion to `notice`, unnamed dialog to `other`.
  - The fact evaluator (`D/runtime/facts/evaluate.ts`, `condition.ts`) answers `obstruction visible|absent` and keeps
    `dialog` as an alias.
- **CC8 rate limit.** `web.action.rate_limited` (`D/actions/extraction/summary.ts:143-183`, `E/content/actions/click.ts:20-27`)
  becomes a `rate_limit` obstruction, with `retryAfterMs` only when the page states it.
- **CC9.** Print `stateful` and one computed `state` per control at look time:
  - from `LE/page-view/element/state-tokens.ts` and `LE/control-spot/stateful.ts`;
  - for controls whose state lives in their words or class, from `D/actions/toggle-signature/derive.ts` and
    `class-delta.ts`, learned from an earlier press of the same kind of control.
  - Keep `idempotentWith` (`D/actions/schemas.ts:255`).
- Tests: `E/content/action-runtime/tests/actionability-obstruction.test.ts`, `D/runtime/facts/tests/obstruction-fact.test.ts`,
  `LE/page-view/element/tests/state-tokens-stateful.test.ts`.
- Browser check: these are content-script changes, so run a manual browser test on a realistic scenario (photo-social)
  alongside Core P6's live check.

### W7. Typed fields, marks, row identity, the date twin (CC1, CC2, CC3, K1)

- **CC1.** `E/content/extraction/value-shape.ts` today changes only the label. Emit a `type` (`currency`, `number`,
  `count`, `date`, `text`, `url`) and the parsed value beside each sample (`LE/structure/field-sample.ts:20-52`,
  `LE/structure/packet.ts:127-215`). `kind` in `D/actions/extraction/request.ts:20` stays a read mode.
- **CC2.** Marks per row (a badge, a flag, a state icon that is not a text cell) come from `E/content/extraction/badge-name.ts`,
  `record-control.ts`, `item-record/` and `infer-fields.ts`, as `fieldMarks` on the packet. `D/actions/extraction/condition-grammar.ts`,
  `request.ts:96-150` and `E/content/extraction/item-filter.ts` accept `is present` on a mark.
- **CC3.** `rowIdentity` comes from link identity (`D/actions/extraction/request.ts:75`, `E/content/extraction/link-identity/`)
  and the key columns re-find already uses (`D/runtime/target-reacquire/row-key-columns.ts`).
- **K1 twin.** The date bounds in `E/content/extraction/item-filter.ts`, `D/actions/extraction/condition-grammar.ts` and
  the plan-resolution conditions must keep the same semantics as Core's `condition-holds.ts`. Add the date cases to the
  shared parity cases.
- Tests: `LE/structure/tests/packet-type-marks.test.ts`, `D/actions/extraction/tests/condition-date.test.ts`,
  `E/content/extraction/tests/item-filter-date.test.ts`, `E/content/extraction/tests/marks.test.ts`.

### W8. Transient faults, actionability, effect class, identity re-find (CC8, CC10, CC12)

- **CC8 `transient`.** `D/runtime/failure/codes.ts` and `D/runtime/adapter.ts:264` set it. The English "retry later"
  phrases leave Core (P8) and live here as the domain's classifier.
- **CC10.** `E/content/action-runtime/actionability.ts` reports `actionable {ok, reason, coveredBy}` on the dispatch
  result. The `LOADING busy` header (`LE/page-view/header.ts`) maps to `busy`.
- **CC12.** The effect class per action kind comes from `D/runtime/lasting-act-statement.ts`,
  `D/client/interrupted-action/commits.ts` and `LE/node-run/run.ts` (`webPlanStepMustDeclare`). A purchase-like
  submit is `commit`, so Core never lowers it.
- **Re-find by identity without a source step.** `D/runtime/target-reacquire/reacquire-target.ts` and `element-match.ts`
  answer from the stored fingerprint against the current view.
- Tests: `D/runtime/failure/tests/transient.test.ts`, `D/runtime/target-reacquire/tests/identity-only.test.ts`,
  `D/runtime/tests/lasting-act-class.test.ts`.

### W10. Receive the concepts Core gives up (CC11, CC13, CC14)

See the next section.

## Moving web concepts out of Core

Each item leaves Core in Core's P10 and arrives here in the same Core-paired unit. Core keeps only a generic fallback.
The web binding supplies today's behaviour, so web prompts and refusals do not change.

| Core item (Core path) | Arrives at | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 56 lines of `web.dom.*` and `web.browser.*` node ids, plus medium words and examples, in `flow-bootstrap/plan/flow-script-format.ts`; `web.` literals in `issue-feedback.ts`, `candidate-trial/feedback.ts`, `repeat-guard/outcomes.ts`, `harness/locator-text.ts`, `submission-refusal.ts` | `LE/system-instructions/instructions.ts` and the node descriptions in `LE/harness-options/options.ts` | CC13 |
| English accepting words, lead words and the close-glyph regex (`script-statements/way-out-steps.ts:71-75`) | new `LE/control-intent/` classifier (icon, label, layer position; per-language lists) | CC11 |
| Commerce act vocabulary (`instructed-acts/kind-words.ts:4-11`, `instruction-acts.ts:78`, `act-object.ts:50`) and run-time act words (`executor/step-skip/act-not-done.ts:26`) | the binding's `actVocabulary` from `LE/harness-options/options.ts` | CC14 |
| `dialog` fact and target (`script-statements/fact-condition.ts:95`, `service/runtime-session/interruption-handler.ts:40`, `plan/contracts.ts:125`, `harness-options/plan-fact-targets.ts:17`) | `D/runtime/facts/evaluate.ts`, `condition.ts` answer `obstruction` (alias kept) | CC7 |
| Closed layer kinds `consent\|promotion\|dialog` (`executor/node-execution/cleared-layer.ts:13`) | the kind mapping in `LE/node-run/press-effect/cleared-layer.ts` | CC7 |
| DOM fingerprint keys and weights (selector 14, xpath 11 and others; `model/action-element-target.ts`, `fingerprinting/element-fingerprint.ts`) | `D/element-fingerprint/build.ts`, `signals.ts` name the signals and weights | open signals map (P10) |
| Transient phrases (`llm/repeat-guard/retry-later.ts:7`, `executor/defensive/thrown-error.ts:43,214`) | `D/runtime/failure/codes.ts` | CC8 |

Rules for the move:

- New web examples use a different kind of site from the ten realistic scenarios, as Core's do today.
- Core's script-format examples are rewritten, not copied.
- Validation: build the web binding's system prompt before and after the move and compare. The only difference allowed
  is ordering. Run a domain test that each moved list is supplied whole.

## Web phases: validation and live checks

- **W0. Lab verdict from structured data.**
  - `packages/test-runner/src/flow-lane/creation/candidate-outcome.ts` (`chatDraftVerdict`, which reads Core's prose;
    t753 `TOLD_DRAFT`) reads Core's structured ending instead.
  - `packages/test-contracts/src/evaluation.ts` gains `not_judged` for a run that called no judge.
  - A token-reservation under-estimate (mvskptb1: 14,643 reserved against 15,093 reported) must not relabel a playback
    failure as `performance.budget`. W0's first step is to locate that classification in the test-runner.
  - Tests in the `tests/` folder beside each file.
  - Live: none on its own; it rides in the first round.
  - Unit: `pnpm task start fhl-lab-verdict`.
- **Narrow validation for W3-W10:**
  - the domain and extension typechecks;
  - `cd domain && DOMAIN_TEST_BUILD_LABEL=fhl-w<N> node scripts/test-domain.mjs <path fragments of the changed dirs>`;
  - `cd apps/extension && EXTENSION_TEST_BUILD_LABEL=fhl-w<N> node scripts/test-extension.mjs <fragments>`;
  - the structure audit, against the paired Core worktree.
  - No full suites; those stay in the twice-a-day sweep.
- **Browser checks.**
  - Content-script, actionability, layer and extraction changes (W6, W7, W8) get a manual browser check on the
    Chrome/Edge build, recording the page and extension state.
  - Any Playwright content-harness spec uses only the ten realistic scenarios.
- **Live checks:** the scenario named in each paired Core phase, in a visible browser, started from the extension chat,
  with the UI reviewed.

## Web what not to do

Core's "What not to do" applies in full. Web-specific additions:

- Never put a scenario's control words (its "Join", "Like" or "Return" labels) into the intent classifier, a mark name
  or any model-facing text. Marks and intent are computed from structure.
- Never let a region token include volatile text.
- Never lower an action's class below what the page shows it does.
- Never emit a field that is guessed rather than read. An unknown field is absent, not false.

## Work Ledger

### 2026-10-29 - P0 merged: scenario-free model text, enforced by a check (t793)
- Agent: supervisor; worker (brief t793), review follow-up t793-R (worker); the script format's example rewritten in t790; report `framework-heavy-lifting-plan/reports/t793-p0.md`
- Changed: Core model-facing text in `llm/diagnosis-instructions.ts`, `llm/node-tools/run-node.ts`, `flow-bootstrap/plan/evidence-schema.ts`, `service/candidate-trial/processed-out.ts`, `result-verification/repair-directive.ts` now uses reading lists, archives, branch libraries and report filing in place of cart, coupon, store, checkout and excluded-part examples; t790 replaced `flow-script-format.ts`'s "Garden Club" membership example with a print shop. Downstream `scripts/check/model-text.mjs` (in `pnpm check`) builds 209 tokens from the ten realistic scenarios' fixture literals and fails on any in the string and template literals of Core's model-facing files (TypeScript compiler parse; comments excluded); a reviewed allow list of 8 generic words; a retired-examples list.
- Decision (supervisor review): allow-list entries must match a current Core literal; "Space Grey" (a task's answer variant, found only in comments) is not allowed.
- Validation: supervisor-run `node --test scripts/check/model-text/tests/*.test.mjs` -> "# pass 8 / # fail 0"; on the tree merged with dev (t790 in) `node scripts/check/model-text.mjs` -> "model-text: ok (209 scenario tokens, 376 model-facing Core files, 11720 string literals)"; Core under the heavy-check lock `pnpm test` llm, flow-bootstrap/plan, result-verification, service/candidate-trial -> "Test Files 443 passed (443)", real-sql 2 passed; prompt contracts "Tests 70 passed (70)"; after a library rebuild `pnpm check` -> exit 0 (without it, a stale apps/web dist failed it, as on t792: a tooling gap, follow-up); docs current; structure audit passed.
- Outcome: Accepted. The check catches names, not a scenario's shape in common words; review stays needed for shape.

### 2026-10-29 - Core's check never reads a stale library build (t794)
- Agent: supervisor; worker (brief t794), report `framework-heavy-lifting-plan/reports/t794-check-build.md`
- Finding: twice on 2026-10-29 a merge that changed `packages/fluxiq` source failed Core's `pnpm check` in apps/web (`TS2739 ... IdentityAccessService is missing ...`) until the libraries were rebuilt by hand: apps/web reads the compiled dist for the `fluxiq/*` subpaths tsconfig `paths` does not map to source.
- Changed (Core): the root `check` script runs `contracts:build`, `fluxiq:build` and `client-gateway-websocket:build` through the build cache before the parallel typechecks; `scripts/build-cache/tests/registry.test.mjs` fails if they are dropped or reordered; `docs/architecture/code-structure.md` says so. Option (b), source paths for every export, was rejected: a second list to keep in sync.
- Validation: supervisor-run `node --test scripts/build-cache/tests/registry.test.mjs` -> "# pass 10 / # fail 0"; `pnpm check` -> exit 0 in 39 s with nothing changed; `pnpm structure:check` passed. Worker's probe: a new export used from apps/web without a manual build -> fluxiq:build rebuilt (92 s) and web:check passed; cold check 4 m 14 s, warm 34 s.
- Outcome: Accepted.

## Open Questions

1. **Are `values` and `differs` filled for a non-list region, such as a cart drawn with div elements?** Owner: W3. This
   was taken from the mvswhobv run note and not checked in `LE/start-state/`. It is the premise of Core P3's region witness.
2. **Tab and resource identity.** `resetResource` is a session plus tab identity, so an item opened in a new tab makes
   earlier references unusable. Should witnesses key on the resource across tabs, or should Core carry the resource
   between tabs? Owner: W3, with Core Lane B.
3. **Place token per act.** Does `LE/control-spot/place.ts` embed the page address for a looped act? If so, fix it here
   or let Core compare by one place per act (Core P4). Owner: W4. The mvrj-a44a chain was inferred with no ledger trace.
4. **Stateful controls whose state lives in words or a class.** Can they be known before the first press, or only
   after one press of the same kind of control? Owner: W6. If only after, CC9 is filled late, and Core keeps
   `ensureState` from trial presses.
5. **Which languages does the intent classifier (CC11) cover first?** Owner: W10. Absent intent never refuses in Core,
   so coverage can grow over time.
6. **Can the list packet carry per-item values for every field?** Core P7's discriminating-field note needs them.
   Owner: W7.
7. **Does `extractList` honour a `done when` end marker as the read's bound?** (mvskodlp F4; not verified.) Owner: W7.
