// One process at a time runs a given step in a given tree.
//
// Two processes that decide to build the same step at once -- two `pnpm build`
// runs, a `pnpm check` beside a Lab prelude -- would both delete the stamp, both
// write the same outputs and each fingerprint the other's half-written files.
// So the build path of `runStep` holds a lock beside the step's stamp, and a
// second process that finds it held waits, then decides again: by the time it
// holds the lock the first has normally stamped the step, and the second
// reuses what it built.
//
// The lock is a file created only if absent: its content is written to a
// private temporary file and hard-linked into place, and `link` fails when the
// name exists, so no reader ever sees a lock without its owner. A lock is stale
// when its owner's pid is no longer running on this machine, or when the file
// is older than `staleMs` (30 minutes: longer than any build here, and the
// bound on how long a hung or recycled-pid owner can hold a step). A stale lock
// is broken by renaming it aside and checking the renamed file is the one that
// was judged stale; one that was replaced in between is put back.
