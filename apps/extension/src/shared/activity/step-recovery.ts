// The recovery one of Core's `step` rows reports, read from the raw activity
// event (state-aware recovery plan, C11; `ClientGatewayActivity.detail.recovery`).
//
// Core puts a closed `recovery` on a step row when a lifecycle handler ran, a
// frame began at an alternative entry, the run took a route, an alternative
// path was tried, or the extension closed a layer the page put in the way
// (`interference`, subject "Closed a notice the page put in the way"), so a
// card can be drawn from closed fields rather than by parsing Core's sentence.
// This is the one reader: it keeps the field only on a `step` row and only in
// the contract's shape, so a panel never draws a card from a value an older or
// newer Core sent in another form.
//
// Pure: no browser API.
