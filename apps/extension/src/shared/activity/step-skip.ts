// The skip one of Core's `step` rows reports, read from the raw activity event
// (t416; `ClientGatewayActivity.detail.skipped`).
//
// Core puts a closed `skipped` on a step row when a run step was skipped rather
// than run: its act was already done in this run for the same row
// (`already_done`), a sometimes-present step's target was not shown
// (`optional_absent`), or the page was elsewhere and state routing passed it
// over (`state_routed`). This is the one reader: it keeps the field only on a
// `step` row and only in the contract's shape, so a panel never draws a card
// from a value an older or newer Core sent in another form.
//
// Pure: no browser API.
