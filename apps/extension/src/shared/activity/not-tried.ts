// What a call Core rejected before sending it says, as an outcome a person
// reads after the action's dash.
//
// A `web.action.rejected.*` code is FluxIQ declining to send a call, never
// the page failing it: nothing was looked up or pressed. Its target code
// (`target_unobserved`) read "couldn't find it on the page" for a list read
// whose step named no list properly (reason `malformed_handle`) while the list
// was in plain sight (R2-U-6 of the run-muwansvz-a2b4a987 UI review, steps
// 0034, 0039 and 0046). So a rejected call is "not tried", and, when the row
// carries the caller's reason (`Reason: <code>` in its record), why: Core's
// own words for that reason (`activityActionFailureReason`, the words its card
// says), less the "FluxIQ didn't send it, as" its card opens with, which "not
// tried" already says. A step reading a list names the list, not a control
// ("the step didn't say which list to read"). Without a reason, the code's own
// last words say why when they say something other than a page miss
// ("a popup or banner on the page was covering it"); a page miss is never
// said, since the page was not asked. Pure.
