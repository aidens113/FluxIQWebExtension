// Which activity events are steps a person should see. Only what the model
// decided and what really happened on the page (or to the automation) is a
// step. Core's own bookkeeping is not: the page captures it takes to tell
// whether a step changed anything (state digests), the check it runs before
// answering a repeated look from memory, and the internal tools the build loop
// calls on itself (budget, history, request and decision checks, reading its
// own draft). Shown as rows, these made the chat say "Looking at the page"
// five times before FluxIQ had done anything
// (docs/working/language-driven-flow-loop-plan/reports/looking-at-page-repeat.md).
// Shared, because the background leaves them out of the history it keeps for
// the chat (`background/activity/unit-history.ts`) and the chat leaves them
// out of its step messages. No DOM.
