// Whether one of Core's raw activity events is the model's words rather than
// what FluxIQ is doing.
//
// Core says each step of the model's thinking as a `thought` row whose `text`
// is the model's own: its reason for the next step ("Store chooser is open;
// I'll press …"), a refused edit to the draft with the model's summary as the
// thing not done ("That step has no such value to make vary; … so this was not
// done: adding the pape…"), or a recovery choice. The chat tells those as
// messages (`panel/chat/stream/`). The status -- the overlay and the chat's
// live line -- says the phase and the current action only (D6 of the
// run-musp4h2f-72e8ed99 UI review), so the pacer never makes such a row its
// detail and does not count it as a change (`background/activity/pacer.ts`).
//
// Core's own deciding row ("Deciding the next step", `runtime/activity/
// observer.ts`) is a thought too, but it is the action: with no text while the
// decision is made, and with Core's own sentence when the model provider did
// not answer. It is status, and is drawn.
//
// Pure: no browser API.
