// What one of Core's raw activity events says, in a person's words.
//
// Core speaks in its own terms: "Using core.run_node: web.action.rejected.
// not_at_start_location". Those ids are exact and belong in the record (the
// event's `detail.ref` and `detail.text`, for a row a person chooses to
// expand), never in the words a person reads at a glance. This module is
// the only place that turns an event into those words, so the overlay, the
// chat header and the chat rows cannot drift apart:
//
// - a tool is named by what it does to the page ("Looking for the list of
//   items"); a model decision, while it is being made, by what it is for
//   ("Deciding the next step"), and once made by the model's own stated reason
//   for it; the completion check by what it checks;
// - a tool's result code becomes a short outcome ("done", "couldn't find it
//   on the page", "that didn't work: the page took too long"); a call FluxIQ
//   declined to send (`web.action.rejected.*`) is "not tried", with why when
//   the row says (`not-tried.ts`), never a page miss; a decision Core declined
//   before doing it (a call or a whole Flow refused as a repeat, an edit
//   refused) is "not done", with Core's reason. None of them says what comes
//   next: "that didn't work, trying another way" was said before the same
//   Flow was sent again unchanged, and before the build ended (lane C,
//   run-mv0fuotv-805294d7, defect 3);
// - Core's own sentence is kept when it is already human ("Running step 2 of
//   5: Open search", "Saved 12 records"), and replaced by the phase's plain
//   wording when it carries an id.
//
// Core names what a tool call does from the call's own input (its
// `detail.title`, e.g. "Clicking “Get a free quote”"), marks a dry run's calls
// `verifying` ("Trying the Flow from the start: …") and its own bookkeeping
// calls as `note` rows. Those words are used as they come, ahead of any table
// here; the rules above are the fallback for a Core that sends only the tool
// id, and "Thinking about the next step" for one that sends no detail.
//
// Pure: no browser API, no clock. Nothing here matches `RAW_ID`.
