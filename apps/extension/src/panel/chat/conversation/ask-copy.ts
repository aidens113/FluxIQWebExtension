// How a question FluxIQ asked in the thread is shown, and what each answer
// sends (UI audit, section 4, "3. Conversation card": "A turn that carries a
// Core ask shows the ask's options as buttons, which send answer-ask with
// { askId, kind, value }").
//
// The answer kinds are Core's (`automationStudioConversationAnswerFits`): a
// permission or a confirmation is granted or refused, a choice names an
// option by id, an open question takes words. A question this panel cannot
// answer -- a kind it does not know, or a choice with no options -- says so and
// points to FluxIQ, rather than offering buttons Core would refuse.
//
// An answered robot check says nothing under its turn: the check's own card
// in the stream ("Robot check · Done. You pressed Continue.") already tells
// the press, and a "You chose "Continue"." here made it the second of three
// tellings of one press (D7 of the run-murwd8le-79e735a8 UI review). The check
// is told from every other ask by Core's option ids for it
// (`runtime/parking/person-needed-ask.ts`), never by its words.
