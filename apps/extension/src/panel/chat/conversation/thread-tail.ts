// The end of a thread: the last few turns, read from Core.
//
// Core's `get-conversation` pages forward from the start, or from after
// `sinceTurnId`. The card wants the end, so it reads forward from an anchor --
// the turn just before the first one on screen -- and keeps only the last
// `TURN_WINDOW` turns it sees, moving the anchor up as older turns fall off.
// Every read replaces what is on screen with Core's answer from the anchor on,
// so an ask answered elsewhere shows as answered; nothing is merged locally.
//
// A thread longer than `MAX_PAGES` pages is read in steps: the read reports
// itself incomplete, and the next one carries on from the new anchor.
