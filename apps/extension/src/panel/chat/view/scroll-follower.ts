// Keeps the chat pinned to its newest content while the person is at the
// bottom (`isAtBottom`), and lets go the moment they scroll up. Following is
// decided by the person's own scrolling, not by the content: content that
// grows below a reader never pulls them down, and "Jump to latest" shows for
// as long as they are away from the bottom.
//
// Only the person ends following: a scroll that left the view off the bottom
// while they were turning the wheel, touching, pressing a scroll key or
// dragging the scroll bar. Every other scroll is the browser's. It fires for
// the follower's own `scrollTop` write (and content can grow before that
// event is dispatched), and Chrome's scroll anchoring moves the view on its
// own when content above the top line changes size: a card above shrinking
// while the newest grows keeps the content's height, so no ResizeObserver
// fires, and anchoring moves the view up off the bottom. Treating that as the
// person parked the chat above the hand-off question and the build's ending
// (D16, run musq0b1m). After a scroll that is not the person's, a follower
// goes back down. Content that grows in place (a card's status changing, a
// line replaced) is followed through a ResizeObserver on the scrolled content.
