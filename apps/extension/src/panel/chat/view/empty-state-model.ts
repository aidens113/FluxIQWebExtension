// What an empty chat says, and what it offers. The latest chat's empty thread
// is the onboarding once connected: a paragraph saying what FluxIQ does, two
// starts (describe a job, or extract data from the page without AI), the
// example prompts, and, when FluxIQ has no model key it may use, a line
// saying so. It shows only while the thread is empty, so nothing remembers a
// first run. The examples only fill the composer, so the person reads and
// edits one before anything is sent; they show only when a message could be
// sent now. An automation's empty chat asks about that automation; a
// question's empty thread offers nothing to start from. No DOM.
