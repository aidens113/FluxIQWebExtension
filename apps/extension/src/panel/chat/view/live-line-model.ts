// What the live line at the end of the chat says while FluxIQ works: the
// paced display's headline and detail (`ExtensionActivityState.display`), and
// the step. The background paces the display, so this line changes at a
// readable rate however fast Core's events arrive. Between a send and the
// first activity it says the message is on its way. While the work waits for
// the person (a robot check, Core's person-needed ask) it stays up and says
// what Core asked of them, because "Waiting for you" alone says nothing of
// what to do. When the question is in a thread not on screen, it offers the
// one action that puts it in front of the person: opening that thread
// (`action`, "Show the question"). No DOM.
