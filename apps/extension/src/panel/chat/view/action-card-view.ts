// One action FluxIQ took, as a card in the chat: its icon in a round mark
// tinted by how it went, Core's short name for the kind and what it acted on
// on one line, and how it went in words on the next.
//
//   ( icon )  Click · Get a free quote
//             Didn't work: it wasn't on the page
//
// A target is one line, cut at the end by the stylesheet as a last resort,
// except one the words mark `whole` (Core's name for a list, which is never
// cut or renamed: R2-U-8), which wraps at its spaces.
//
// The card is a labelled group: its accessible name says the kind, the
// target and the outcome, and the icon is hidden. The element lives as long
// as the card; an update changes only the words and marks that changed (the
// icon too, when Core's reading of the kind changes as the action ends), so
// a card never remounts or flickers. Text goes in through `textContent` only.
