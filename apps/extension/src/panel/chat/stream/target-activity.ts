// The live activity that belongs in the chat on screen. No DOM.
//
// The events are the relay's `history` -- each recent unit of work's whole
// story -- or, from a background that keeps none, its `recent` window.
//
//   - Work that speaks through another thread (any of its events names a
//     different `conversationId`) belongs to that thread, and never shows in
//     this one, whichever chat this is -- except in the question chat opened
//     for that very work.
//   - The latest chat shows everything else, as FluxIQ's own chat does.
//   - An automation's chat shows only the work on that automation: events
//     whose subject names its Flow, or that speak through the thread on
//     screen.
//   - A question's chat (the thread a build or a run asked the person in)
//     shows the work that asked, and what speaks through the thread on screen.
//
// The live line follows the paced display while the unit of work it
// describes is one this chat shows, and always while that work waits for the
// person: a question nobody sees is a build or a run stopped for good, so
// every chat says so. When the question is not in the thread on screen,
// `answerIn` names the thread that holds it (`askThread`), and the live line
// offers to open it.
