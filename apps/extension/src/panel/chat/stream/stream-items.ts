// The chat's message stream as data: Core's thread turns and FluxIQ's step
// messages (`stepMessages`) on one timeline. No DOM, no folds: every step is
// its own message, where it happened.
//
// What the person asked a build is their message even when it never passed
// through this thread: a build started from FluxIQ, an automation's settings
// or a test harness reads its instruction from the Flow, and the chat showed
// FluxIQ working on a request nobody could see (live runs 34 and 35). A build
// says the person's words on its activity (`request`); each becomes a turn of
// theirs where the build said it, unless the thread already holds those words
// from them -- a request typed into this chat is not shown twice.
//
// Order. By time: a turn's from the turn clock, a step message's from the
// event that opened it (an unreadable `at` takes the message before it, so the
// relay's order holds). On equal times a turn goes first, then everything in
// its own order. A message's time never changes, so once placed it stays put.
