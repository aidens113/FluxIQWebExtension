// Steps done again, as one line in the chat that opens to show them. No DOM.
//
// Before a step is tried again, the work does the steps before it again first
// (Core's "Doing an earlier step again first", "Checking an earlier step is
// still done"), and a test of the Flow runs it from its start. Each pass was a
// full card per step, all of them already in the chat: before every retry the
// repair printed 4-6 success cards again -- Accept all, 7-in-1, Spain, Get
// coupons, +, Space Grey -- and the stream filled with repeated successes (D7
// of the t342 round 2 UI review, run-muylu4pp-f9cb2121, screenshots 09-13).
//
// So, within one message, two or more cards in a row that each did their work
// on something a card of the same unit of work already did -- the same kind,
// the same named target, the same test mark -- are one card that holds them
// (`again`): it keeps the first one's key, and so its place, and reads "Did 3
// earlier steps again: Accept all, 7-in-1 and Spain" (`doneAgainWords`); the
// view opens it to show each card as it was. A step done again alone, one
// still under way, one that did not work, one Core refused, and one with no
// name a person could tell apart is a card of its own, as before.
