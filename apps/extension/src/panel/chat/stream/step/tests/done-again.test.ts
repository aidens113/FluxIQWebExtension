// D7 of the t342 round 2 UI review (run-muylu4pp-f9cb2121, screenshots 09-13):
// before each retry of a step, the repair did the steps before it again first,
// and every pass printed 4-6 full success cards that were already in the chat
// (Accept all, 7-in-1, Spain, Get coupons, +, Space Grey). Steps done again are
// one line that says so and opens to show them.
