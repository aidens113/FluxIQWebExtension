// Coverage of recovery-message.ts, recovery-words.ts and their place in
// messages.ts and retried.ts: each recovery Core reports on a run step (the
// rows Core's `emitAutomationStudioActivityStepRecovery` sends) is its own
// message with its reasoning and a card, per kind, event and outcome, in plain
// words; a retry or a planned way round never reads as a failure; a recovery
// in the middle of a retry leaves "Done on the 2nd try" whole; and a step row
// with no recovery keeps today's reading.
