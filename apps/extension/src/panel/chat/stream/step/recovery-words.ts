// A recovery Core reports on a run step (state-aware recovery plan, C11), in
// a person's words: the message's title and its reason, and its card's icon
// kind, short name and, when it was held back, why.
//
// Each kind of recovery reads by what it did for the run, never by Core's own
// terms ("handler", "On Before", "checkpoint", "entry") or a step's number:
//
//   handler      an extra step done around a step: something cleared out of
//                the way before it, a step done before trying again, the
//                planned way round when a step can't be done, a tidy-up after
//                it. Card "Extra step · Close the sign-up box / Done".
//   entry        a part started further along because what comes before was
//                already done. Card "Start from · Pick a time / Done".
//   route        the run carried on from the point the page was already at.
//                Card "Carry on from · Basket / Done".
//   alternative  another way to the same place, used when the usual one
//                didn't work. Card "Other way · Basket link / Done".
//   interference a notice the page put over itself, closed so the step could
//                go on. Core's own words are the line ("Closed a notice the
//                page put in the way"), so the card names no target: "Clear
//                the page / Done". Never a failure: one Core could not close
//                reads "Not done: it was still in the way".
//   fixing       reserved for the step fixed inside the run after it truly
//                failed (in-run repair, R4b): "Fixing a step", card "Fix step".
//                Core reports it on no row yet; its words are here so that
//                card reads like the others when it comes.
//
// A retry or a planned way round is never said as a failure: only a recovery
// that itself didn't work says "didn't work". One held back before it ran
// (`refused`: a guard or the run's budget of tries) says "Not done" and why,
// never "didn't work", since nothing was tried. The words name the step the
// recovery was for when the chat already knows its label ("Did this before
// “Add the kettle”, then carried on"), and say it without one otherwise. The
// subject is Core's plain words for the recovery itself, shown on the card;
// it is never page data. No DOM.
