// A step in the words a person uses. An older Core named its steps by tool and
// node ids ("Using core.run_node", "Result: web.inspect.succeeded"); the chat
// never shows one of those. A title Core (or the background) already wrote in
// words is kept -- a tool's too: Core names what a call does and on what
// ("Clicking “No thanks”", "Reading the details of “Colour”"), and reading the
// call's result code instead turned each of those into "Looked at the page" or
// "Worked on the page" (t193, `run-muqiojz4-04a7a8fc`). Only a title that is
// an id reads as what its tool did, in the present while it is under way and
// in the past once it is done; an id nobody mapped reads as "Used a tool"
// rather than as the id. Result codes and lists of issue codes are dropped,
// since the step's mark already says whether it worked. No DOM.
