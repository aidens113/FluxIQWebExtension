// Cards that only repeat what the chat already shows, as one card each that
// counts them.
//
// The build's model can ask for the same thing again and again after Core
// declined it, or try the same call and see it fail the same way, and each
// was a card of its own:
//
// - three "Edit the Flow · run the step again / Not done: that step was
//   already tried exactly this way ..." cards in a row read as three pieces of
//   work (U-8 of the run-muw60j7c-bb7c9a62 UI review);
// - a refused rerun and the rerun of a list read that Core did not send
//   alternated, "Edit the Flow / Not done" then "Read list / Didn't work", one
//   pair per attempt (R2-U-7 of the run-muwansvz-a2b4a987 UI review, steps
//   0033-0046).
//
// So a card that did nothing -- a decision Core declined in whole, or an
// action that didn't work -- folds into an identical card shown earlier in the
// same stretch of cards: same unit of work, and the same kind, target, test
// mark, outcome and reason, so the same words. A stretch is the cards that
// follow one another with nothing new between them. Words of FluxIQ's (a
// decision with its reason, a repair, a note) end it, and so does a card that
// did anything, even in part, which is never folded. A card that is new to the
// stretch after one of its cards has already repeated starts a new stretch, so
// the order still reads true: A B A B A B is A (3 times) and B (3 times), and
// A B A C A is A (2 times), B, C, A. The card folded into keeps its key and
// its place and says how many times it stands for (`times`; "Not done (3
// times): ...", "Didn't work (3 times): ...", `card-words.ts`). A message
// that was only folded cards is gone; one with words keeps them.
//
// A card that did its work folds too, but only into the card shown just
// before it, when that one says the same, result and all: five reruns of one
// list read stacked five identical "Read list · name, price and 4 more /
// Done" cards (R3-U-5 of the run-mux6naez-6c20f26e UI review), and are one
// "Done (5 times)". Only the card just before, so done, failed, done never
// reads as "Done (2 times)" then a failure; another row count is another
// result, shown apart; a card still under way or waiting is never folded. No
// DOM.
