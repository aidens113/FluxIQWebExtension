// A step that didn't work and then worked when it was tried again, as one
// card that says so.
//
// A press inside a repeat that the site refused, then made again on the same
// row, read as a red "Click · Confirm / Didn't work: ..." card and, below the
// retry's note, a green "Click · Confirm / Done" card: nothing said they were
// the same press on the same row (lane D, run-mv0fuual-f9e6f089, finding 2).
//
// So a card that did its work takes in the failed card just before it in its
// unit of work when both say the same act on the same thing, and both are
// steps a run or a test of the Flow ran (Core's recovery tries those again by
// itself; a build's own call made again is the model's choice): the same kind,
// name, target (a row included) and test mark, and a target at all, since
// two unnamed presses may be any two controls. The failed card is taken out,
// and the one that worked says on which try, and why the earlier ones did not
// ("Done on the 2nd try. The first try didn't work: the site asked FluxIQ to
// slow down"; `retried`, `card-words.ts`). Only the run's own notes may come
// between them: Core's recovery says "Trying the step again" as a repair, and
// a note says what it did meanwhile. Another card, or a decision of the model's,
// ends it: a decision's words may say why the first did not work, and it would
// lose the card it speaks of. A recovery Core reported meanwhile (a step done
// before trying again, `recovery-message.ts`) is passed over: it is no try of
// the step, and it neither ends the retry nor is taken in. A refusal is no
// try, and a result check or a test run is no step, so neither is taken in. A
// message left with no card and no words of its own is gone. No DOM.
