// One recovery Core reported on a run step, as its own chat message: what
// happened and why in words (`recovery-words.ts`), and a card naming what it
// acted on and how it went. Drawn from the row's closed `recovery` fields
// (`stepRecovery`), never from Core's sentence. No DOM.
//
// The card says "Done" for a recovery that moved the run on, "Didn't work"
// for one that itself failed, and "Not done: ..." for one held back before it
// ran, which takes no failure's colour (`card-words.ts`).
