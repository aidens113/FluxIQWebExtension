// One action FluxIQ took, ready for its card in the chat: Core's shared
// reading of the event (`activityActionOf` in `fluxiq/ui`: the kind that
// picks the icon and the card's name, what it acted on, where it stands, and
// why it failed) plus what the chat needs to keep the card in place and say
// it in words. No DOM.
//
// Where a card stands comes from `activityActionOf` alone. A question to the
// person (an `ask`: a robot check or a permission) waits on them until Core's
// row that settles it says how it ended (`detail.resolution`); that row's
// sentence ("You pressed Continue.") is the card's `answer`. Nothing here
// reads the resolution's values, so a new one needs no change. Core's own
// sentence about any other action (`said`) is kept only when it is in words;
// a line that names an id or a result code ("Result: web.click.succeeded ·
// Node: web.output.dom-click") is not words. Core's marks that a step was part
// of a test run (`testing`), that a result check could not confirm the
// result (`unconfirmed`), and that Core declined a decision before doing it
// (`refused`: a call refused as a repeat, an edit refused in whole or in
// part, with Core's plain reason) are carried as Core gave them.
