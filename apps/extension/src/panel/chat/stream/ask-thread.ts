// The thread that holds the question work is waiting on, as a chat target.
// No DOM.
//
// Core puts a question to the person in the thread of the work's own
// subject, not in the thread the work was started from (the `conversationId`
// its activity events carry, which is the chat that asked for it, if any):
//
//   build  its Flow's thread: Core subject `flow`, the Flow's id. A build's
//          permission question and its check only a person can complete both
//          go there (Core `runtime/service.ts`, `parkingPort({ subject: { kind:
//          "flow", id: flowId } })`).
//   run    the run's own thread: Core subject `run`, the run's id (graph-run
//          parking, `parkingPort({ subject: { kind: "run", id: runId } })`).
//
// So "Waiting for you" can show in a chat that does not hold the question, or
// the question can sit in a thread no chat shows (a run started from the
// automations tab). `askThread` names the thread that holds it, so the chat
// can open it and the person can answer there. Undefined when nothing is
// waiting on the person, or when a waiting build named no Flow, since then
// there is no thread to find.
