// When each thread turn happened, so turns and activity rows can be placed on
// one timeline.
//
//   - a turn Core stamped (`createdAt`) takes that time. Core stamps live
//     activity on the same clock, so the two interleave exactly;
//   - an unstamped turn of the first read is history and sorts before every
//     activity row (the caller passes `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` as `now`);
//   - an unstamped turn seen later takes `now`, the time this panel first saw
//     it -- within 300 ms of Core's write, since the thread is re-read that
//     long after an event that names a conversation;
//   - no turn is ever earlier than the one before it, so the thread's own
//     order always holds;
//   - a turn keeps its time on every later read, and turns that left the
//     thread's window are forgotten.
