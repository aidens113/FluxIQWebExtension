// Which thread the chat opens so the person watches a followed run's steps
// live (the shell switched to Chat because the run started, `panel/shell/run-follow.ts`).
// No DOM.
//
// Whether a chat shows a run is `activityForTarget`'s rule, asked of the run's
// own event, so the two never disagree:
//
//   - A run that speaks through no thread (started from the automations strip,
//     or over the API) shows in the latest chat and in its own automation's
//     chat. The automation's chat is preferred when the panel knows the Flow's
//     name, since that chat is about this run alone; otherwise the latest.
//   - A run that speaks through a thread (`conversationId`: started from a
//     chat) shows only in that thread. The chat opens the latest chat or the
//     Flow's chat only when it has read that thread before and knows its id
//     is the run's; otherwise it opens the run's own thread (a `question`
//     target of subject `run`), where every event of the run shows and where
//     Core would ask the person anything the run needs.
//   - A chat that already shows the run is kept: the person is not moved.
