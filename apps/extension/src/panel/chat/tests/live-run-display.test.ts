// The mounted chat, end to end under a fake DOM, for four display defects the
// chat-driven Lab runs of 2026-10-01 showed:
//
// - U-B1: the welcome screen in the middle of a build, in every chat-driven run
//   (`run-muq3ubys-4b4dbf5b`, `run-muq5vb5w-b50aaab7`, `run-muq6mlom-2ae53681`):
//   the moment a first message's send returned and before its thread was read;
// - U-B2: a chat-started build's stop said twice, by its failed marker and by
//   the chat's answer;
// - U-A1: a press the run failed on read "Done" just above "Run failed"
//   (`run-muq6lqnw-fdfa7aac`);
// - U-A2: a merge step's card read "Action · the page", then "Join paths": a
//   step a person never sees, now not shown at all (t174-w90).
