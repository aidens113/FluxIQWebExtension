// The headline a person reads for a unit of work: what it is while it runs,
// and how it ended. It names the work, never the step inside it, so it stays
// put while Core's sentences change underneath (the detail line carries those).
//
// Three situations change it besides the work settling (U8 and U9 of the t174
// live lane's UI review):
//
// - **Repair.** Once Core starts repairing the Flow -- a run working out a fix
//   for a failed step, a build re-authoring an answer its check refuted -- the
//   work reads "Fixing your Flow", not "Building your Flow". A run that only
//   presses a failed step again (the page was busy) is not repairing anything
//   and keeps "Running your Flow" (D12 of the t174 UI review of
//   run-musp8nz1-dbd3905a; the pacer tells the two apart, `run-retry.ts`).
//   A run whose repair ends in failure reads "Couldn't fix your Flow": the run
//   had a Flow, and it could not be fixed. A build that fails reads "Build
//   failed" whether or not it was repairing: its repair re-authors the Flow
//   the build is making, so a creation that ends unfinished had no Flow to fix
//   (t195 live run `run-musp474o-e0ed7432`, 12-failure-scenario). The subject
//   kind is what tells the two apart; Core's activity does not say whether a
//   build creates a Flow or extends one, so an extending build that fails
//   reads "Build failed" too.
// - **A check only the person can answer.** When a page action reports that
//   the page asks for what only a person can give (a robot check, a code
//   prompt), the headline says so plainly: "Waiting for you: finish the check
//   on the page".
// - **A question.** Core's own waiting state (`waiting_permission`, a run
//   paused on an ask) reads "Waiting for you: answer in the FluxIQ panel".
