// Folds Core's raw activity events into the one status a person reads
// (`ActivityDisplay`), at a pace a person can read.
//
// Core reports every seam of its work: a build asks the model, runs a tool,
// reads the result and asks again, often inside one second. Shown as they
// come, those events flip the status several times a second (the t185
// overlay did, and people called it flicker). The pacer keeps what they say
// and changes how often it is said:
//
// - `headline` names the unit of work ("Building your Flow", "Running your
//   Flow", "Fixing your Flow") and changes only when the work changes,
//   settles ("Flow ready", "Build failed") or needs the person ("Waiting for
//   you: finish the check on the page"). Those changes show at once, however
//   recently the detail changed (`headline.ts`, `unit-situation.ts`).
// - `detail` is Core's latest event in a person's words (`activityWording`:
//   no tool id or result code ever reaches it). It changes at most once per
//   `detailIntervalMs`: the first change in a quiet period shows at once, and
//   any that arrive before the period ends wait for its end, where only the
//   newest is shown. Nothing is dropped for good -- the last sentence always
//   reaches the screen -- so a stale one is never left showing. A sentence
//   that only repeats the headline is dropped (`isHeadlineEcho`).
// - This is the only pace. The panel's status row and the page overlay both
//   draw this display as it comes, so they say the same thing at the same
//   moment (D7 of the t174 UI review of run-musp8nz1-dbd3905a: the overlay
//   kept a dwell of its own and lagged the panel by most of a second). The
//   interval is long enough that any three seconds of paced changes show at
//   most two, which is what the Lab's UI review reads as steady.
// - A step that finished well is said by its action alone, never "— done":
//   the chat's card says Done, and the status must not still say "— done"
//   once the next step is under way (D6 of that review).
// - A decision being made ("Deciding the next step", Core's reasonless row
//   that opens every decision) does not replace a meaningful line: the last
//   one -- the step it ran, the stage it is in -- is held until something of
//   the work's own replaces it. Showing each opening row flashed the status
//   about once a second for a whole re-author (U9 of the run-musp39u8-9ac026ab
//   UI review). It shows only when nothing meaningful is up yet.
// - A step that starts after a decision shows at once: the status never says
//   "Deciding the next step", or the line held through the decision, beside
//   the card of the step the decision chose (D7 of the t174 review). A
//   decision takes the model's time, so this cannot make it flicker.
// - The model's words -- its reason for a step, a refused edit, a recovery
//   choice (`isModelThought`) -- are never the detail. The chat tells them;
//   the status keeps the unit's last action line, phase and step, and the
//   display is marked `kind: "thought"`. Such an event is not a change of the
//   detail: it neither starts the interval nor takes the place of an action
//   still waiting for it, so the action after a thought is not held back (D6
//   and D13 of the run-musp4h2f-72e8ed99 UI review). It still settles,
//   headlines and opens a unit of work like any other event, and it still
//   passes through `UnitSituation` and `RunRetry`.
// - A run that presses a failed step again is still running the Flow, not
//   fixing it: Core's recovery ladder keeps the headline "Running your Flow"
//   and the detail says why it tries again ("The page was busy, trying
//   again"), through the recovery choice that follows it, which is a thought
//   (D12 of the t174 review). Only Core working out a repair heads it "Fixing
//   your Flow" (`run-retry.ts`).
// - `phase` and `step` move with `detail`, so the colour, the mark and the
//   step count cannot change faster than the words beside them. A repair of
//   the Flow itself is on no step of the run, so the count does not carry
//   into it (`unit-situation.ts`).
// - A settling event -- `final`, `failed` or waiting for the person -- changes
//   the headline or the outcome, so it skips the wait and replaces anything
//   still waiting. So does a new stage Core announces ("Judging the Flow", a
//   result check's verdict, the person's answer ending a wait): the status
//   follows the newest stage, never the step that finished before it.
// - The person's answer to a wait is not repeated as the detail: the thread
//   already says it.
//
// Pure apart from the injected clock: no browser API, no network.
