// The status during a candidate trial, fed the rows Core really sends
// (lane A round 5, `run-muz0f12h-eae63685`, t366). t363 headed a trial
// "Testing your Flow" from the build's `core.test_candidate` tool row, but Core
// sends no such row: the candidate authoring loop runs its two tools itself,
// outside the `executeTool` the activity observer wraps
// (`flow-bootstrap/candidate/authoring-loop.ts`), so a trial reaches the
// activity stream only as the decision's thought ("Testing the whole Flow from
// the start", sent when the model gave a reason) and then the trial run's own
// rows: "Running step N of M", a failed step's "Recovering from a failed
// step", the recovery ladder's choice, all in the build's unit of work. The
// overlay samples of that run read "Building your Flow | Step 2 of 10" during
// trial 2 and "Fixing your Flow | Step 9 of 10 | Looking over the whole page"
// after it.
//
// The rows below follow Core's emitters: `activity/observer.ts` (the decision
// rows and the exploring tool rows), `activity/step/started.ts`,
// `activity/step/recovering.ts`, `executor/state-routing/announcement.ts` and
// `activity/wording/recovery-choice.ts` (the ladder's choice, as round 5's Core
// worded it).
