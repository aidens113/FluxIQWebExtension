// What one unit of work is in the middle of, beyond its latest event: whether
// Core is repairing the Flow, and whether the page is waiting on a check only
// the person can answer. Both last across events -- a repair spans many model
// calls and page steps, and a robot check stays on the page while the build
// keeps deciding what to do -- so the headline they choose cannot be read off
// one event alone (`headline.ts`).
//
// Every event of the unit passes through `observe`, whether or not the pacer
// shows it, so a repair or a check that begins inside a paced interval still
// changes the headline at once.
//
// What Core reports, and nothing guessed:
//
// - A repair begins with a `repairing` event: a run's "Recovering from a failed
//   step", a build's "Repairing the Flow: the result check refuted its
//   answer". For a run it ends when the run reports its next step; for a build
//   it lasts until the build settles or its result check passes (the `check`
//   row titled "Result check", `succeeded`): Core sends no "repair finished",
//   and a repaired result the check accepted is no longer being fixed (D10 of
//   the t174 UI review of run-murwd8le-79e735a8: "Fixing your Flow" stayed up
//   through the cross-check that followed a passed check).
// - A repair of the Flow itself -- a re-author after the result check refuted
//   a run's answer, Core's "Repairing the Flow" row ("Result repair started")
//   -- is on no step of the run, so the run's step count does not carry into
//   it (U2 of t194, run-musp39u8-9ac026ab: "Fixing your Flow · Step 5 of 5"
//   for the whole four-minute re-author). It lasts until the run reports its
//   next step, which is the repaired Flow's re-run counting its own steps. A
//   run recovering from one failed step is still on that step and keeps it.
// - A check needs the person when a page action's result code is the
//   extension's `web.intervention.required` (`domain/src/runtime/failure/
//   codes.ts`: the page asks for what only a person can give -- a robot check,
//   a code prompt). Core has no event of its own for this; the result code on
//   the build's tool event is the one signal there is. It ends when a later
//   page action succeeds, a run reports its next step, or the wait on the
//   person settles -- Core's closing `ask` row, sent when the person pressed
//   Continue or Stop or nobody answered (D7 of the same review: after
//   Continue the overlay still said "Waiting for you").
// - A run held between steps (Core's `paused` phase, a Take over) gives the
//   page to the person. When Core lets it go on (`running`, "Continuing from
//   step N") whatever stood on the page was theirs to deal with, so a check
//   ends then too, even when the held step has no number (a Merge).
