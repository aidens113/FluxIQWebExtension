// Tells a run that presses a failed step again from a run whose Flow is being
// repaired. Core reports both in its `repairing` phase: its recovery ladder
// ("Recovering from a failed step", then a choice such as "Trying the step
// again", Core's `activity/wording/recovery-choice.ts`) and its repair of the
// step ("Working out what went wrong", "Deciding how to repair the step").
// Only the second changes the Flow, so only the second heads the status
// "Fixing your Flow"; a retry keeps "Running your Flow" and says why it tries
// again ("The page was busy, trying again": D12 of the t174 UI review of
// run-musp8nz1-dbd3905a, where the overlay said "Fixing your Flow" while the
// chat rightly said "Trying the step again"). Every `repairing` event of a
// build is a repair; a build's test of its Flow is told as a run (`pacer.ts`).
//
// "Trying again" is said only once the ladder chose to press the step again.
// The failed step's row comes before the ladder decides, so it says only why
// the step failed ("The page turned it down"): a refusal the ladder never
// retries read "The page turned it down, trying again" until the ladder's end
// took it down (t366, lane A round 5, `run-muz0f12h-eae63685`).
//
// Every event of the unit passes through `observe`, the model's thoughts
// included: a recovery choice is a thought row, and it is what keeps a retry
// a retry (`pacer.ts`).
