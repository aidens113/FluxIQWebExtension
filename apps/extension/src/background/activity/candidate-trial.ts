// Tells a build's test of its Flow apart from the rest of the build, so the
// status names it as a test of the Flow, never as a repair.
//
// A candidate creation build tests each Flow it submits by running it once,
// from its start, with no model (Core's `runtime/service/candidate-trial/
// run.ts`). That run reports its steps under the build's own unit of work, and
// a step that fails in it reports Core's "Recovering from a failed step" row in
// the `repairing` phase, as any run's failed step does. Read as the build's own
// events, that row headed the status "Fixing your Flow" with the trial's "Step
// 2 of 8", and the heading stayed after the trial ended (lane A round 4,
// `run-muyrpbnk-fef374e7`): nothing was being fixed.
//
// What Core sends, and nothing guessed. t363 opened the test on the build's
// tool row for `core.test_candidate`, but Core sends no such row: the candidate
// authoring loop runs its own two tools outside the `executeTool` the activity
// observer wraps (Core's `flow-bootstrap/candidate/authoring-loop.ts`), so lane
// A round 5 (`run-muz0f12h-eae63685`) still read "Building your Flow | Step 2
// of 10" through trial 2 and "Fixing your Flow | Step 9 of 10" after it (t366).
// A test reaches the stream as:
//
// - the decision's thought, titled with Core's own words for the test tool
//   ("Testing the whole Flow from the start", `activity/wording/core-tool.ts`),
//   sent only when the model gave a reason;
// - the run's rows: a "Running step N of M" row carries `step`, which only the
//   graph executor sends (`activity/step/started.ts`). A build runs its Flow's
//   steps only to test it, so a build's row with a `step` is its test running;
// - the build's tool row for `core.test_candidate`, should Core ever send it:
//   it opens the test (`started`) and closes it with the trial gate's verdict
//   (record "Result: candidate.trial_<verdict>", `flow-bootstrap/candidate/
//   trial-gate.ts`).
//
// The test ends when the build goes back to its own work: the next decision
// ("Deciding the next step", Core's row opening every decision), any other
// tool row, or the unit settling.
