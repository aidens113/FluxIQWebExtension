// A press on a control something covers is not sent (t223, C4 and C9 of
// `run-mup2i28c-6c7fc209`).
//
// The look a node takes before it acts marks every control a layer paints over
// with `coveredBy` (`../layers.ts`). Sent anyway, the click lands on the layer:
// live, a store button under a timed email popup was "pressed", the click
// closed the popup through its backdrop, the result said `succeeded` and
// `pageChanged`, and the store chooser it was for never opened. Refused, the
// call carries the page with the layer in it, and says which handles cover the
// control, so the next call deals with the layer and then presses again.
